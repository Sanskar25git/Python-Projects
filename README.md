# Python-Projects
This project aims to develop a weather prediction application using Python and
Tkinter. The application will allow users to enter their location and view
current weather conditions, as well as other parameter in weather forecast. The
project will utilize web scraping techniques to obtain weather data from online
sources, and then process and display this data using a GUI built using Tkinter.
The GUI will include a map with a marker indicating the user's location, as
well as various widgets to display weather information such as temperature,
humidity, wind speed, and pressure. The application will also include a feature
to notify users of severe weather alerts in their area. This project will provide a
practical application of Python programming and Tkinter GUI development
skills in the context of weather prediction and analysis.
